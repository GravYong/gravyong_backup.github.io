Muchas gracias to [Alejandro
Cárdenas-Avendaño](https://acardenasavendano.org) for inviting me to
give a webinar for the [Lating American Webinar on Physics (lawphysics)](https://lawphysics.wordpress.com).
Want to hear me talk about numerical relativity and theories beyond
GR? Well, you're in luck, because the transmission is on YouTube for
you to watch! It was really fun, and viewers had great questions.

*Title*: Testing Einstein with numerical relativity: the precision
frontier, and theories beyond general relativity

*Abstract*: Advanced LIGO and Virgo have already detected black holes
crashing into each other ten times. With their upgrades we anticipate
a rate of about 1 gravitational-wave detection per week. More signals
and higher precision will take the dream of testing Einstein’s theory
of gravity, general relativity, and make it a reality. But would we
know a correction to Einstein’s theory if we saw it? How do we make
predictions from theories beyond GR? And do current numerical
relativity simulations have enough precision that we could be
confident in any potential discrepancy between observations and
predictions?
