The
[Event horizon telescope (EHT)](http://www.eventhorizontelescope.org/)
is a project aiming to image the event horizon of the supermassive
black hole at the center of our galaxy using radio waves (and a lot of
other cool science!). Their
collaboration
[held a workshop](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/sma/EHT2016/) this week
and kindly invited me to give an overview of past, present, and future
tests of general relativity. It was great to come back and visit
Cambridge and hear about all the progress they're making.

Here are [my slides]({{ site.url }}/files/present-future-tests-GR.pdf) and
a movies (right click and save

from EHT16.
Enjoy!

**Title**: Present and future tests of general relativity

**Abstract**: We're now a century after the conception of general
  relativity. With technology's steady advance, observations are
  finally beginning to access the most extreme environments predicted
  by GR: the event horizons of black holes, both stellar mass and
  supermassive. As empiricists, we have the obligation to test GR in
  this new regime. I will review some present approaches to black-hole
  based tests of general relativity, comment on their shortcomings,
  and motivate future studies which will inform the next generation of
  GR tests.
