Just an update on talks I gave recently.  Valeria Ferrari, Leonardo
Gualtieri, and Paolo Pani hosted the conference "[New Frontiers in
Gravitational-Wave
Astrophysics](https://agenda.infn.it/conferenceDisplay.py?ovw=True&confId=12616)"
at Sapienza University in Rome, and graciously invited me to speak
about "Numerical black holes and mergers in theories beyond GR"
([slides available from their web
site](https://agenda.infn.it/conferenceTimeTable.py?confId=12616#20170621.detailed):

Then in July, Thomas Sotiriou invited me to come visit the University
of Nottingham (home of Robin Hood).  I gave two talks: first, a more
general one, "Probing strong-field gravity: black holes and mergers in
general relativity and beyond" for non-experts; and second, to
Thomas's strong-gravity group meeting, a talk covering my [recent work
on separing metric perturbations in near-horizon extremal Kerr]({{
