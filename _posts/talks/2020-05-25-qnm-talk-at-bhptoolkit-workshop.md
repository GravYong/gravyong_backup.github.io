Last week I gave an invited talk at the [Spring 2020 workshop of the
Black Hole Perturbation
Toolkit](http://astro.cas.cz/bhptoolkit2020/program.html)
(BHPToolkit).  The [BHPToolkit](http://bhptoolkit.org/) is a
collection of open source code and the people who work this code,
focused on the problem of black hole perturbation theory.  This is
mostly motivated by needing to model extreme mass-ratio inspirals
(EMRIs) for the future space-based [LISA
mission](https://www.lisamission.org/) to detect gravitational waves
at low frequencies.

Thanks to the scientific and local organizers for the invitation to
present, and for putting together a great program, all held online! I
think it was a huge success. At one point there were about 110 people
on Zoom, and another 25 watching on YouTube.

Speaking of which, if you missed the event live, all the materials are
online for posterity.  There is a [BHPToolkit YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuQQbp9Buq-R3da4zASTFfw).
My talk was on Monday, at around 04:11:00:

For my presentation, I talked about my [qnm python
package](https://github.com/duetosymmetry/qnm).  I prepared a [colab
jupyter notebook on
qnm](https://bit.ly/qnm-pres)
where you can follow along with the code demonstration and examples.
I hope you try it out and use my package!
