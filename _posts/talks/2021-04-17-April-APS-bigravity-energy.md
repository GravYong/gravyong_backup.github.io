I haven't been posting every time I gave a talk, so here is a sporadic
update.  I contributed a talk to the 2021 April APS meeting.  This
talk is a status update on work done in collaboration with Alex Saffer
and Shammi Tahura, both at UVA.  The topic is how to compute the
energy content of gravitational waves in Hassan-Rosen bimetric
gravity, a.k.a. bigravity.  There's no publicly available recording,
but you can [see my slides here]({{ site.url }}/files/bigravity-energy.pdf).
