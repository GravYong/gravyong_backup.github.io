Some time ago I hit the 'old man shaking his fist at a cloud' age.
Then Springer took over Living Reviews in Relativity and moved all the
papers into their infrastructure.  Along with this move was the demise
of the LRR server and the old LRR author index (snapshot seen
[here](https://web.archive.org/web/20161125104822/http://relativity.livingreviews.org/Articles/author.html)
from the Internet Archive).

Thanks to the magic of INSPIRE's xml and writing
[a bit of python code](https://github.com/duetosymmetry/lrr-index),
I was able to resurrect my own copy of the author index.  I don't know
if anybody else will find it useful, but you can browse it here:
[LRR author index]({{ site.url }}/lrr-index/).
