> `qnm` is an open-source Python package for computing the Kerr
> quasinormal mode frequencies, angular separation constants, and
> spherical-spheroidal mixing coefficients. The `qnm` package includes
> a Leaver solver with the Cook-Zalutskiy spectral approach to the
> angular sector, and a caching mechanism to avoid repeating
> calculations. We provide a large cache of low $$\ell, m, n$$ modes,
> which can be downloaded and installed with a single function call,
> and interpolated to provide good initial guess for root-polishing at
> new values of spin.
