> Binary black hole mergers are of great interest to the astrophysics
> community, not least because of their promise to test general
> relativity in the highly dynamic, strong field regime.  Detections
> of gravitational waves from these sources by LIGO and Virgo have
> garnered widespread media and public attention. Among these sources,
> precessing systems (with misaligned black-hole spin/orbital angular
> momentum) are of particular interest because of the rich dynamics
> they offer.  However, these systems are, in turn, more complex
> compared to nonprecessing systems, making them harder to model or
> develop intuition about. Visualizations of numerical simulations of
> precessing systems provide a means to understand and gain insights
> about these systems. However, since these simulations are very
> expensive, they can only be performed at a small number of points in
> parameter space. We present <em>binaryBHexp</em>, a tool that makes use of
> surrogate models of numerical simulations to generate on-the-fly
> interactive visualizations of precessing binary black holes. These
> visualizations can be generated in a few seconds, and at any point
> in the 7-dimensional parameter space of the underlying surrogate
> models. With illustrative examples, we demonstrate how this tool can
> be used to learn about precessing binary black hole systems.
