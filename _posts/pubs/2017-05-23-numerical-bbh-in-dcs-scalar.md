Here's a movie from one of the simulations we ran for this paper:

> Testing general relativity in the non-linear, dynamical,
> strong-field regime of gravity is one of the major goals of
> gravitational wave astrophysics. Performing precision tests of
> general relativity (GR) requires numerical inspiral, merger, and
> ringdown waveforms for binary black hole (BBH) systems in theories
> beyond GR. Currently, GR and scalar-tensor gravity are the only
> theories amenable to numerical simulations. In this article, we
> present a well-posed perturbation scheme for numerically integrating
> beyond-GR theories that have a continuous limit to GR. We
> demonstrate this scheme by simulating BBH mergers in dynamical
> Chern-Simons gravity (dCS), to linear order in the perturbation
> parameter. We present mode waveforms and energy fluxes of the dCS
> pseudoscalar field from our numerical simulations. We find good
> agreement with analytic predictions at early times, including the
> absence of pseudoscalar dipole radiation. We discover new
> phenomenology only accessible through numerics: a burst of dipole
> radiation during merger. We also quantify the self-consistency of
> the perturbation scheme. Finally, we estimate bounds that
> GR-consistent LIGO detections could place on the new dCS length
> scale, approximately $$\ell \lesssim \mathcal{O}(10)$$ km.
