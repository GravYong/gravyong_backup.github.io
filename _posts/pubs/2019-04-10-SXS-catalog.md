> Accurate models of gravitational waves from merging black holes are
> necessary for detectors to observe as many events as possible while
> extracting the maximum science. Near the time of merger, the
> gravitational waves from merging black holes can be computed only
> using numerical relativity. In this paper, we present a major update
> of the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) Collaboration catalog of
> numerical simulations for merging black holes. The catalog contains
> 2,018 distinct configurations (a factor of 11 increase compared to
> the 2013 SXS catalog), including 1426 spin-precessing
> configurations, with mass ratios between 1 and 10, and spin
> magnitudes up to 0.998. The median length of a waveform in the
> catalog is 39 cycles of the dominant $$\ell=m=2$$ gravitational-wave
> mode, with the shortest waveform containing 7.0 cycles and the
> longest 351.3 cycles. We discuss improvements such as correcting for
> moving centers of mass and extended coverage of the parameter
> space. We also present a thorough analysis of numerical errors,
> finding typical truncation errors corresponding to a waveform
> mismatch of $$\sim 10^{-4}$$. The simulations provide remnant masses
> and spins with uncertainties of 0.03% and 0.1% (90$$^{\text{th}}$$
> percentile), about an order of magnitude better than analytical
> models for remnant properties. The full catalog is publicly
> available at [https://www.black-holes.org/waveforms](https://www.black-holes.org/waveforms).
