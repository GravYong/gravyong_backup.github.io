> Black holes are a powerful setting for studying general relativity
> and theories beyond GR. However, analytical solutions for rotating
> black holes in beyond-GR theories are difficult to find because of
> the complexity of such theories. In this paper, we solve for the
> deformation to the near-horizon extremal Kerr metric due to two
> example string-inspired beyond-GR theories:
> Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet, and dynamical Chern-Simons theory. We
> accomplish this by making use of the enhanced symmetry group of NHEK
> and the weak-coupling limit of EdGB and dCS. We find that the EdGB
> metric deformation has a curvature singularity, while the dCS metric
> is regular. From these solutions we compute orbital frequencies,
> horizon areas, and entropies. This sets the stage for analytically
> understanding the microscopic origin of black hole entropy in
> beyond-GR theories.
