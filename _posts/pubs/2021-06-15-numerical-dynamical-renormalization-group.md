> Perturbation theory is a crucial tool for many physical systems,
> when exact solutions are not available, or nonperturbative numerical
> solutions are intractable. Naive perturbation theory often fails on
> long timescales, leading to secularly growing solutions. These
> divergences have been treated with a variety of techniques,
> including the powerful dynamical renormalization group (DRG). Most
> of the existing DRG approaches rely on having analytic solutions up
> to some order in perturbation theory. However, sometimes the
> equations can only be solved numerically. We reformulate the DRG in
> the language of differential geometry, which allows us to apply it
> to numerical solutions of the background and perturbation
> equations. This formulation also enables us to use the DRG in
> systems with background parameter flows, and therefore, extend our
> results to any order in perturbation theory. As an example, we apply
> this method to calculate the soliton-like solutions of the
> Korteweg-de Vries equation deformed by adding a small damping
> term. We numerically construct DRG solutions which are valid on
> secular time scales, long after naive perturbation theory has broken
> down.
