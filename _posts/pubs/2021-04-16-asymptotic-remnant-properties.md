> We present a new study of remnant black hole properties from 13
> binary black hole systems, numerically evolved using the Spectral
> Einstein Code. The mass, spin, and recoil velocity of each remnant
> were determined quasi-locally from apparent horizon data and
> asymptotically from Bondi data $$(h, \psi_4, \psi_3, \psi_2,
> \psi_1)$$ computed at future null infinity using SpECTRE's Cauchy
> characteristic evolution. We compare these independent measurements
> of the remnant properties in the bulk and on the boundary of the
> spacetime, giving insight into how well asymptotic data are able to
> reproduce local properties of the remnant black hole in numerical
> relativity. We also discuss the theoretical framework for connecting
> horizon quantities to asymptotic quantities and how it relates to
> our results. This study recommends a simple improvement to the
> recoil velocities reported in the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes
> waveform catalog, provides an improvement to future surrogate
> remnant models, and offers new analysis techniques for evaluating
> the physical accuracy of numerical simulations.
