> Black hole spacetimes, like the Kerr spacetime, admit both stable
> and plunging orbits, separated in parameter space by the
> separatrix. Determining the location of the separatrix is of
> fundamental interest in understanding black holes, and is of crucial
> importance for modeling extreme mass-ratio inspirals. Previous
> numerical approaches to locating the Kerr separatrix were not always
> efficient or stable across all of parameter space. In this paper we
> show that the Kerr separatrix is the zero set of a single polynomial
> in parameter space. This gives two main results. First, we
> thoroughly analyze special cases (extreme Kerr, polar orbits, etc.),
> finding strict bounds on the limits of roots, and unifying a number
> of results in the literature. Second, we pose a stable numerical
> method which is guaranteed to quickly and robustly converge to the
> separatrix. This new approach is implemented in the Black Hole
> Perturbation Toolkit, and results in a ~45x speedup over the prior
> robust approach.
