> Only numerical relativity simulations can capture the full
> complexities of binary black hole mergers. These simulations,
> however, are prohibitively expensive for direct data analysis
> applications such as parameter estimation. We present two new fast
> and accurate surrogate models for the outputs of these simulations:
> the first model, NRSur7dq4, predicts the gravitational waveform and
> the second model, surfinBH7dq4, predicts the properties of the
> remnant black hole. These models extend previous 7-dimensional,
> non-eccentric precessing models to higher mass ratios, and have been
> trained against 1528 simulations with mass ratios q≤4 and spin
> magnitudes χ₁,χ₂≤0.8, with generic spin directions. The waveform
> model, NRSur7dq4, which begins about 20 orbits before merger,
> includes all ℓ≤4 spin-weighted spherical harmonic modes, as well as
> the precession frame dynamics and spin evolution of the black
> holes. The final black hole model, surfinBH7dq4, models the mass,
> spin, and recoil kick velocity of the remnant black hole. In their
> regime of validity, both models are shown to be more accurate than
> existing models by at least an order of magnitude, with errors
> comparable to the estimated errors in the numerical relativity
> simulations.
