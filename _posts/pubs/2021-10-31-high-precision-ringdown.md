> Quasi-normal mode (QNM) modeling is an invaluable tool for studying
> strong gravity, characterizing remnant black holes, and testing
> general relativity. To date, most studies have focused on the
> dominant (2,2) mode, and have fit to standard strain waveforms from
> numerical relativity. But, as gravitational wave observatories
> become more sensitive, they can resolve higher-order
> modes. Multimode fits will be critically important, and in turn
> require a more thorough treatment of the asymptotic frame at ℐ⁺. The
> first main result of this work is a method for systematically
> fitting a QNM model containing many modes to a numerical waveform
> produced using Cauchy-characteristic extraction, which is known to
> exhibit memory effects. We choose the modes to model based on their
> power contribution to the residual between numerical and model
> waveforms. We show that the all-angles mismatch improves by a factor
> of ∼10⁵ when using multimode fitting as opposed to only fitting
> (2,±2,n) modes. Our second main result addresses a critical point
> that has been overlooked in the literature: the importance of
> matching the Bondi-van der Burg-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) frame of the
> simulated gravitational wave to that of the QNM model. We show that
> by mapping the numerical relativity waveforms to the super rest
> frame, there is an improvement of ∼10⁵ in the all-angles strain
> mismatch, compared to using the strain whose BMS frame is not
> fixed. We illustrate the effectiveness of these modeling
> enhancements by applying them to families of waveforms produced by
> numerical relativity, and comparing our results to previous
> studies.
