> Quasi-normal mode (QNM) modeling is an invaluable tool for
> characterizing remnant black holes, studying strong gravity, and
> testing general relativity.  Only recently have QNM studies begun to
> focus on multimode fitting to numerical relativity strain waveforms.
> As gravitational wave observatories become even more sensitive they
> will be able to resolve higher-order modes.  Consequently, multimode
> QNM fits will be critically important, and in turn require a more
> thorough treatment of the asymptotic frame at ℐ⁺.  The first main
> result of this work is a method for systematically fitting a QNM
> model containing many modes to a numerical waveform produced using
> Cauchy-characteristic extraction (CCE), a waveform extraction
> technique which is known to resolve memory effects.  We choose the
> modes to model based on their power contribution to the residual
> between numerical and model waveforms.  We show that the all-mode
> strain mismatch improves by a factor of ~10⁵ when using multimode
> fitting as opposed to only fitting the (2, ±2,n) modes.  Our most
> significant result addresses a critical point that has been
> overlooked in the QNM literature: the importance of matching the
> Bondi-van der Burg-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) frame of the numerical
> waveform to that of the QNM model.  We show that by mapping the
> numerical waveforms—which exhibit the memory effect—to a BMS frame
> known as the super rest frame, there is an improvement of ~10⁵ in
> the all-mode strain mismatch compared to using a strain waveform
> whose BMS frame is not fixed.  Furthermore, we find that by mapping
> CCE waveforms to the super rest frame, we can obtain all-mode
> mismatches that are, on average, a factor of ~4 better than using
> the publicly-available extrapolated waveforms.  We illustrate the
> effectiveness of these modeling enhancements by applying them to
> families of waveforms produced by numerical relativity and comparing
> our results to previous QNM studies.
