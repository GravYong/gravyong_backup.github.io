excerpt: "Gravity theories beyond general relativity (GR) can change the properties of gravitational waves: their polarizations, dispersion, speed, and, importantly, energy content are all heavily theory-dependent. All these corrections can potentially be probed by measuring the stochastic gravitational-wave background"

> Chern-Simons gravity, scalar-tensor theory, and Fierz-Pauli massive
> gravity. In each theory, we show how to properly include the
> beyond-GR corrections, and how to interpret observational results.
