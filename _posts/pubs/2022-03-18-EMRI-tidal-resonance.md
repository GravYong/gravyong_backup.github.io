> One of the important classes of targets for the future space-based
> gravitational wave observatory LISA is extreme mass ratio inspirals
> (EMRIs), where long and accurate waveform modeling is necessary for
> detection and characterization. When modeling the dynamics of an
> EMRI, several effects need to be included, such as the modifications
> caused by an external tidal field. The effects of such perturbations
> will generally break integrability at resonance, and can produce
> significant dephasing from an unperturbed system. In this paper, we
> use a Newtonian analogue of a Kerr black hole to study the effect of
> an external tidal field on the dynamics and the gravitational
> waveform. We have developed a numerical framework that takes
> advantage of the integrability of the background system to evolve it
> with a symplectic splitting integrator, and compute approximate
> gravitational waveforms to estimate the time scale over which the
> perturbation affects the dynamics. We find that different entry
> points into the resonance in phase-space can produce substantially
> different dynamics. Finally, by comparing this time scale with the
> inspiral time, we find tidal effects will need to be included when
> modeling EMRI gravitational waves when $$\varepsilon \gtrsim 300
> q^2$$, where $$q$$ is the small mass ratio, and $$\varepsilon$$
> measures the strength of the external tidal field.
