> Binary black holes radiate linear momentum in gravitational waves as
> they merge. Recoils imparted to the black-hole remnant can reach
> thousands of km/s, thus ejecting black holes from their host
> galaxies. We exploit recent advances in gravitational waveform
> modeling to quickly and reliably extract recoils imparted to
> generic, precessing, black hole binaries. Our procedure uses a
> numerical-relativity surrogate model to obtain the gravitational
> waveform given a set of binary parameters, then from this waveform
> we directly integrate the gravitational-wave linear momentum
> flux. This entirely bypasses the need of fitting formulae which are
> typically used to model black-hole recoils in astrophysical
> contexts. We provide a thorough exploration of the black-hole kick
> phenomenology in the parameter space, summarizing and extending
> previous numerical results on the topic. Our extraction procedure is
> made publicly available as a module for the Python programming
> language named surrkick. Kick evaluations take ∼0.1s on a standard
> off-the-shelf machine, thus making our code ideal to be ported to
> large-scale astrophysical studies.
