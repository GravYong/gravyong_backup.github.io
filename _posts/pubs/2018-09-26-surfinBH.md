> We present accurate fits for the remnant properties of generically
> precessing binary black holes, trained on large banks of
> numerical-relativity simulations. We use Gaussian process regression
> to interpolate the remnant mass, spin, and recoil velocity in the
> seven-dimensional parameter space of precessing black-hole binaries
> with mass ratios q≤2, and spin magnitudes χ₁, χ₂≤0.8. For precessing
> systems, our errors in estimating the remnant mass, spin magnitude,
> and kick magnitude are lower than those of existing fitting formulae
> by at least an order of magnitude (improvement is also reported in
> the extrapolated region at high mass ratios and spins). In addition,
> we also model the remnant spin and kick directions. Being trained
> directly on precessing simulations, our fits are free from
> ambiguities regarding the initial frequency at which precessing
> quantities are defined. We also construct a model for remnant
> properties of aligned-spin systems with mass ratios q≤8, and spin
> magnitudes χ₁, χ₂≤0.8. As a byproduct, we also provide error
> estimates for all fitted quantities, which can be consistently
> incorporated into current and future gravitational-wave
> parameter-estimation analyses. Our model(s) are made publicly
> available through a fast and easy-to-use Python module called
> [surfinBH](https://pypi.org/project/surfinBH/).
