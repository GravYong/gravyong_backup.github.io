> We present accurate fits for the remnant properties of generically
> precessing binary black holes, trained on large banks of
> numerical-relativity simulations. We use Gaussian process regression
> to interpolate the remnant mass, spin, and recoil velocity in the
> 7-dimensional parameter space of precessing black-hole binaries. For
> precessing systems, our errors in estimating the remnant mass, spin
> magnitude, and kick magnitude are lower than those of existing
> fitting formulae by at least an order of magnitude. In addition, we
> also model the remnant spin and kick directions. Improvement is also
> reported for aligned-spin systems. Being trained directly on
> precessing simulations, our fits are free from ambiguities regarding
> the initial frequency at which precessing quantities are defined. As
> a byproduct, we also provide error estimates for all fitted
> quantities, which can be consistently incorporated into current and
> future gravitational-wave parameter-estimation analyses. Our
> model(s) are made publicly available through a fast and easy-to-use
> Python module called [surfinBH](https://pypi.org/project/surfinBH/).
