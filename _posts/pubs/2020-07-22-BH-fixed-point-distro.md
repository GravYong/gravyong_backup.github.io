> Understanding distributions of black holes is crucial to both
> astrophysics and quantum gravity. Studying astrophysical population
> statistics has even been suggested as a channel to constrain black
> hole formation from the quantum vacuum. Here we propose a
> Gedankenexperiment to show that the non-linear properties of binary
> mergers (simulated with accurate surrogate models) generate an
> attractor in the space of distributions. Our results show that the
> joint distribution of spin magnitude and fractional mass loss
> evolves to a fixed point, converging in a few generations. The
> features of this fixed point distribution do not depend on the
> choice of initial distribution. Since a black hole merger is
> irreversible it produces entropy – possibly the largest source of
> entropy in the universe. The fixed-point distributions are neither
> isothermal nor isentropic, and initially thermodynamic states evolve
> away from thermality. We finally evaluate the specific entropy
> production rate per merger from initially thermal and non-thermal
> distributions, which converges to a constant.
