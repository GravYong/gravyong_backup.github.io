> Understanding the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) frame of the
> gravitational waves produced by numerical relativity is crucial for
> ensuring that analyses on such waveforms are performed properly. It
> is also important that models are built from waveforms in the same
> BMS frame. Up until now, however, the BMS frame of numerical
> waveforms has not been thoroughly examined, largely because the
> necessary tools have not existed. In this paper, we show how to
> analyze and map to a suitable BMS frame for numerical waveforms
> calculated with the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC). However, the
> methods and tools that we present are general and can be applied to
> any numerical waveforms. We present an extensive study of 13 binary
> black hole systems that broadly span parameter space. From these
> simulations, we extract the strain and also the Weyl scalars using
> both SpECTRE's Cauchy-characteristic extraction module and also the
> standard extrapolation procedure with a displacement memory
> correction applied during post-processing. First, we show that the
> current center-of-mass correction used to map these waveforms to the
> center-of-mass frame is not as effective as previously
> thought. Consequently, we also develop an improved correction that
> utilizes asymptotic Poincaré charges instead of a Newtonian
> center-of-mass trajectory. Next, we map our waveforms to the
> post-Newtonian (PN) BMS frame using a PN strain waveform. This helps
> us find the unique BMS transformation that minimizes the L² norm of
> the difference between the numerical and PN strain waveforms during
> the early inspiral phase. We find that once the waveforms are mapped
> to the PN BMS frame, they can be hybridized with a PN strain
> waveform much more effectively than if one used any of the previous
> alignment schemes, which only utilize the Poincaré transformations.
