> We perform a new test of general relativity (GR) with signals from
> GWTC-2, the LIGO and Virgo catalog of gravitational wave
> detections. We search for the presence of amplitude birefringence,
> in which left versus right circularly polarized modes of
> gravitational waves are exponentially enhanced and suppressed during
> propagation. Such an effect is present in various beyond-GR theories
> but is absent in GR. We constrain the amount of amplitude
> birefringence consistent with the data through an opacity parameter
> $$\kappa$$, which we bound to be $$\kappa \lesssim 0.74 \textrm{
> Gpc}^{-1}$$. We then use these theory-agnostic results to constrain
> Chern-Simons gravity, a beyond-GR theory with motivations in
> quantum gravity. We bound the canonical Chern-Simons lengthscale to
> be $$\ell_0 \lesssim 1.0 \times 10^3$$ km, improving on previous
> long-distance measurement results by a factor of two.
