> Accurate and efficient modeling of the dynamics of binary black
> holes (BBHs) is crucial to their detection and parameter estimation
> through gravitational waves, both with LIGO/Virgo and LISA. General
> BBH configurations will have misaligned spins and eccentric orbits,
> eccentricity being particularly relevant at early times. Modeling
> these systems is both analytically and numerically challenging. Even
> though the 1.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order is Liouville integrable,
> numerical work has demonstrated chaos at 2PN order, which impedes
> the existence of an analytic solution. In this article we revisit
> integrability at both 1.5PN and 2PN orders. At 1.5PN, we construct
> four (out of five) action integrals. At 2PN, we show that the system
> is indeed integrable -- but in a perturbative sense -- by explicitly
> constructing five mutually-commuting constants of motion. Because of
> the KAM theorem, this is consistent with the past numerical
> demonstration of chaos. Our method extends to higher PN orders,
> opening the door for a fully analytical solution to the generic
> eccentric, spinning BBH problem.
