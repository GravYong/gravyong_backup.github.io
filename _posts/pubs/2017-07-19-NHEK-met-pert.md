> Linear perturbation theory is a powerful toolkit for studying black
> hole spacetimes. However, the perturbation equations are hard to
> solve unless we can use separation of variables. In the Kerr
> spacetime, metric perturbations do not separate, but curvature
> perturbations do. The cost of curvature perturbations is a very
> complicated metric-reconstruction procedure. This procedure can be
> avoided using a symmetry-adapted choice of basis functions in highly
> symmetric spacetimes, such as near-horizon extremal Kerr. In this
> paper, we focus on this spacetime, and (i) construct the
> symmetry-adapted basis functions; (ii) show their orthogonality; and
> (iii) show that they lead to separation of variables of the scalar,
> Maxwell, and metric perturbation equations. This separation turns
> the system of partial differential equations into one of ordinary
> differential equations over a compact domain, the polar angle.
