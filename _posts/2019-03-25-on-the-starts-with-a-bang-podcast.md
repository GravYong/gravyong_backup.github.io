[Ethan Siegel](https://twitter.com/StartsWithABang) is an
astrophysicist and science communicator who regular writes [a column
for Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ethansiegel/). When he's not
busy writing, he also records the 
[Starts with a Bang
Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/ethan-siegel-172073460/tracks) which
has been running for 3 years. Ethan was kind enough to invite me on as
a guest for
[Episode 42: Black Holes and
Gravitation](https://soundcloud.com/ethan-siegel-172073460/starts-with-a-bang-42-black-holes-and-gravitation). We
talked about what you would see falling into a black hole, and what
the near future might hold for black hole astrophysics! Enjoy :)
