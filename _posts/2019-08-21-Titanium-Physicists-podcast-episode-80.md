A few months ago you might have heard about the ground-breaking
observations made by the [Event Horizon Telescope
collaboration](https://eventhorizontelescope.org).  If you want an
explainer in podcast form, we've got a treat for you! Ben Tippett had
me back for the third time on his
[Titanium Physicists Podcast](http://titaniumphysicists.brachiolopemedia.com/).
This time it's
[Episode 80: Picturing the Bach Hole](http://titaniumphysicists.brachiolopemedia.com/2019/08/21/episode-80-picturing-the-bach-hole-with-adal-rifai/)
along with Ben,
[Adal Rifai](https://twitter.com/adalrifai) (a.k.a. Chunt, the
shapeshifting king of the badgers),
and the incomparable
[Dr. Katie Bouman](https://people.csail.mit.edu/klbouman/)! I met
Katie when she was a grad student at MIT, working on the imaging
algorithms to take radio data and turn them into what's now one of the
most famous images in the history of astrophysics.  Now she's an
assistant professor in computing and mathematical sciences at Caltech!
This recording was super fun, thanks for having me on again, Ben :)
