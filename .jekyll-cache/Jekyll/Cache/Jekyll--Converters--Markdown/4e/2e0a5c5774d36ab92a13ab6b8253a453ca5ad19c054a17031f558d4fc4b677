I"p<p>I research various aspects of gravity from an astrophysical
standpoint. I’m an Assistant Professor in the <a href="http://physics.olemiss.edu/">department of physics
and astronomy</a> at the University of Mississippi.</p>

<p>I’m mainly interested in testing general relativity, specifically in
the high-curvature regime (think black holes, neutron stars,
gravitational waves).  This page will be updated when I find some free
time.</p>

<p>Please see my <a href="http://localhost:4000/pubs/">publications</a> page for papers and work in
progress. You can also get a list of publications
<a href="http://arxiv.org/a/stein_l_1">on the arXiv</a>,
