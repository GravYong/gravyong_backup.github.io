<h2 id="text">Text</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Main text: <em>Introduction to Electrodynamics</em>, David Griffiths.  We will be covering chapters 7-12.</li>
  <li>The definitive reference, at a higher level, is Jackson’s <em>Classical
Electrodynamics</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="course-goals-and-learning-outcome">Course goals and learning outcome</h2>

<p>This is the second half of a standard course on electromagnetism
in the undergraduate curriculum for physics.</p>

<p>Key concepts (time permitting):
• going from electrostatics to electrodynamics
• mutual and self inductance
• Maxwell’s equations
• conservation laws
• waves in general and electromagnetic waves
• energy and momentum in the electromagnetic field
• reflection, transmission, absorption, and dispersion
• waveguides
• potential formulation and gauge transformations
• special relativity and relativistic EM.</p>

<p>Goals: Reinforce understanding of electrostatics and magnetostatics;
understanding of Maxwell’s equations and interactions with matter, and
relevance to physical systems;
learning tools of waves; applying multivariate and vector calculus and
special mathematical tools (e.g.\ multipole/Legendre expansion);
introduction to special relativity.
These goals are to enhance students’ mathematical reasoning, critical
thinking, and analytical reasoning.</p>

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Grade type: Letter grade A–F</li>
  <li>Grade ranges: (subject to change)
    <ul>
      <li>A 88% and up</li>
      <li>B 75–87%</li>
      <li>C 65–74%</li>
      <li>D 55–64%</li>
      <li>F &lt;55%</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Grade breakdown: (subject to change)
    <ul>
      <li>50% Homework</li>
      <li>20% Midterm</li>
      <li>30% Final</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="homework-tests-and-final-exam">Homework, tests, and final exam</h2>

<p>Homework assignments will be announced via the course web site, and
they must be turned in by 5PM on the due date.  Late homework will be
penalized 20% per day (exceptions and extensions permitted with good
cause).  Homeworks and exams should be submitted as PDFs or JPGs via
the course web site.  Homework must be easy to read: please clearly
write down your name and the problem set number, do not use a red pen.
The midterm and final exam will be open-book and open-notes, and a
calculator will be permitted.</p>

<h2 id="attendance">Attendance</h2>

<p>There is no strict attendance requirement, but you are strongly
advised to attend class.  Attendance has a strong correlation with
performance.  I recommend that you read the book sections in advance
and come ready to participate.
If you miss an exam or cannot turn in homework, please inform me
beforehand and get a doctor’s note if applicable.  Absences from tests
count as zeros, unless they are justified.  If you must be absent
during a test for a University sponsored event, you must discuss this
with me before the test date.</p>

<h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h2>

<p>Violations of the University’s policy of academic integrity will
result in a failing grade and other disciplinary actions.  A student
with a documented case of plagiarism or cheating in this course will
receive a failing grade for the course and may face disciplinary
action by the University, including expulsion.</p>

<p>In particular, do not turn in problem set solutions copied from online
or a solutions manual.  Copying solutions does nothing to enhance your
learning.  If I see this then you will get an automatic 0 for the
problem set.  It if happens more than once I will report it to the
chair of the department.</p>

<h2 id="disability-access-and-inclusion">Disability Access and Inclusion</h2>

<p>The University of Mississippi is committed to the creation of
inclusive learning environments for all students.  If there are
aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in
barriers to your full inclusion and participation, or to accurate
assessment of your achievement, please contact the course instructor
as soon as possible. Barriers may include, but are not necessarily
limited to, timed exams and in-class assignments, difficulty with the
acquisition of lecture content, inaccessible web content, and the use
of non-captioned or non-transcribed video and audio files.  If you are
approved through SDS, you must log in to your Rebel Access portal at
<a href="https://sds.olemiss.edu">https://sds.olemiss.edu</a> to request approved accommodations.  If
you are NOT approved through SDS, you must contact Student Disability
Services at 662-915-7128 so the office can: 1) determine your
eligibility for accommodations, 2) disseminate to your instructors a
Faculty Notification Letter, 3) facilitate the removal of barriers,
and 4) ensure you have equal access to the same opportunities for
success that are available to all students.</p>

<h2 id="other">Other</h2>

<p>If a change in the syllabus becomes necessary during the semester, it
will be discussed in class and then posted on the course website. The
course website will also contain up-to-date information on the class
schedule, homework assignments and complementary material.</p>
