I am currently a PhD student in the [Department of Astronomy](http://vega.bac.pku.edu.cn) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn).

# My research interests 

Gravitational radiations from systems involving neutron stars (NSs)

Free precession of NSs 

Pulsars (Radio and X-ray emissions closely relating to supranuclear matter and strong EM field)

Test gravity in the strong field regime of NSs
