Welcome to my website! I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Computational Relativistic Astrophysics](https://www.aei.mpg.de/comp-rel-astro) group led by [Masaru Shibata](https://www2.yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~masaru.shibata/indexj.html) at the [Albert Einstein Institute](https://www.aei.mpg.de/2772/de) in Potsdam.

Before this postdoc, I was a PhD student in the [gravitational astrophysics group](https://kiaagravity.github.io/about/) led by [Lijing Shao](http://friendshao.github.io/about/) at Peking University. I am also a member of the [pulsar group](https://psr.pku.edu.cn/) at Peking University.

My research interests focus on compact stars and strong-field gravity, with a current emphasis on neutron stars and tests of strong-field gravity. Please visit my [research]({{ site.url }}/research/) page for more detailed information about my research interests. Additionally, you can check out my [publication]({{ site.url }}/publication/) page for a list of my relevant publications and works in progress.
