I am currently a PhD student in the [Department of Astronomy](http://vega.bac.pku.edu.cn) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn).

My research interests 

## Gravitational radiations from systems involving neutron stars (NSs)
## Free precession of NSs 
## Pulsars (Radio and X-ray emissions closely relating to supranuclear matter and strong EM field)
## Test gravity in the strong field regime of NSs
