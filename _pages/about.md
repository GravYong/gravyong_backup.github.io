I am currently a PhD student in the [Department of Astronomy](http://vega.bac.pku.edu.cn/) and the [Kavli Institute for 
Astronomy and Astrophysics](https://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/) at the [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). 

Briefly, my research interests are studying and testing general relativity and other theories of gravity from an astrophysical
standpoint.

I have investigated how “almost-general-relativity” theories can
affect gravitational observables.  An important observation which
would be able to distinguish between GR and almost-GR is the
gravitational waves from two merging black holes, as recently detected
by advanced LIGO.

Please see my [research]({{ site.url }}/research/) page for more
details of my research interests. You can also see my
[publications]({{ site.url }}/pubs/) page for a list of my relevant
publications and work in progress.
