I am currently a PhD student in the
[Department of Astronomy](http://vega.bac.pku.edu.cn) at 
[Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn).

My research interests are studying the equation of state of neutron stars with 
electromagnetic and gravitational radiations.


Please see my [research]({{ site.url }}/research/) page for more
details of my research interests. You can also see my
[publications]({{ site.url }}/pubs/) page for a list of my relevant
publications and work in progress. For a summary, see my
[curriculum vitae]({{ site.url }}/LeoCStein.pdf).
