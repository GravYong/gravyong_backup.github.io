I am currently a PhD student in the [gravitational astrophysics](https://kiaagravity.github.io/about/) group 
of [Lijing Shao](http://friendshao.github.io/about/) at the [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/).
I am also a member of the [pulsar group](https://psr.pku.edu.cn/) at the Peking University.

Briefly, My research interests are probing the dense matter inside neutron stars and testing Einstein's theory of 
general relativity in the strong field of gravity, such as neutron stars and black holes. I mainly use gravitational
waves and pulsar timing to study these two areas.


Please see my [research]({{ site.url }}/research/) page for more
details of my research interests. You can also see my
[publications]({{ site.url }}/publication/) page for a list of my relevant
publications and work in progress.
