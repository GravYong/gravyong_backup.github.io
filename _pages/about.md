Welcome to my website! I am currently a PhD student in the [gravitational astrophysics](https://kiaagravity.github.io/about/) group 
of [Lijing Shao](http://friendshao.github.io/about/) at the [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). I am also a member of the [pulsar group](https://psr.pku.edu.cn/) at the Peking University.

Briefly, My research interests center around compact stars and strong-field gravity. 
For now, I mainly focus on neutron stars and tests of strong-field gravity.
Please see my [research]({{ site.url }}/research/) page for more
details of my research interests. You can also see my
[publications]({{ site.url }}/publication/) page for a list of my relevant
publications and work in progress.
