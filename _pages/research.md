# Neutron stars
<hr style="border:1px solid gray">

NSs are the most compact known objects without event horizons and serve as extreme laboratories to 
study the super-dense nuclear matter. To give a realistic matter description, we need 
to account for supranuclear matter physics, superfluidity/superconductivity, strong magnetic fields, elasticity and so on. 
So, the problem of understanding the composition and state of matter under extreme conditions inside 
NSs presents a great challenge in fundamental physics and astrophysics. 


Studying gravitational dynamics of systems involving NSs and extracting physical properties relating to different aspects of 
the dense matter from gravitational waves (GWs) and pulsars' electromagnetic radiation are the general goals of my research.


# Testing gravity:  
<hr style="border:1px solid gray">

General Relativity (GR) describes gravity by means of geometry of spacetime. Theoretically, it is incompatible with quantum theory and predicts spacetime singularities under generic conditions. Observationally, the unknown dark matter and dark energy take up $95\%$ energy content of our Universe, which may indicate that gravity is in fact something beyond GR. These fundamental questions motivate us to test GR and our ultimate goal is to see whether it will fail in regions of the parameter space that are accessible to our experiments or observations.
