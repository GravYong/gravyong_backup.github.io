# Neutron stars
<hr style="border:1px solid gray">

Neutron stars (NSs) are the most compact objects known to exist without event horizons, and they serve as extreme laboratories for studying super-dense nuclear matter. To provide a realistic matter description, we need to account for supranuclear matter physics, superfluidity/superconductivity, strong magnetic fields, and elasticity, among other factors. Therefore, understanding the composition and state of matter under extreme conditions inside NSs presents a significant challenge in fundamental physics and astrophysics.

My research focuses on studying the gravitational dynamics of systems involving NSs and extracting physical properties related to different aspects of dense matter from gravitational waves (GWs) and pulsars' electromagnetic radiation. 

# Gravity tests in the strong-field regime of compact objects
<hr style="border:1px solid gray">

General Relativity (GR) describes gravity by means of geometry of spacetime. Theoretically, it is incompatible with quantum theory and predicts spacetime singularities under generic conditions. Observationally, the unknown dark matter and dark energy take up 95% energy content of our Universe, which may indicate that gravity is in fact something beyond GR. These fundamental questions motivate us to test GR and our ultimate goal is to see whether it will fail in regions of the parameter space that are accessible to our experiments or observations.
