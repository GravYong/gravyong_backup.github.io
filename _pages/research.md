I research various aspects of gravity from an astrophysical
standpoint. I'm an Assistant Professor in the [department of physics
and astronomy](http://physics.olemiss.edu/) at the University of Mississippi.

I'm mainly interested in testing general relativity, specifically in
the high-curvature regime (think black holes, neutron stars,
gravitational waves).  This page will be updated when I find some free
time.

Please see my [publications]({{ site.url }}/pubs/) page for papers and work in
progress. You can also get a list of publications
[on the arXiv](http://arxiv.org/a/stein_l_1),
[on ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#search/q=author%3A%22Stein%2C%20Leo%20C.%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc),
or [on INSPIRE](http://inspirehep.net/search?p=exactauthor%3AL.C.Stein.2).
